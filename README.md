It's the code for "Vampire Survivor like" demo I wrote for exploring using ECS(Mass) inside UnrealEngine long time ago.

I decided to give up for the rest of the engine is OOP, and ECS is not well supported at the moment. I have to reinvent the wheel for every gameplay system if I want to have pure ECS.

So, it's not actively maintained anymore.
